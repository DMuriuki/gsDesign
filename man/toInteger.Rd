\title{Translate group sequential design to integer events (survival designs)
or sample size (other designs)}
\usage{
toInteger(x, ratio = 0, roundUpFinal = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{gsDesign} or \code{gsSurv}.}

\item{ratio}{A non-negative integer, usually corresponding to
experimental:control sample size ratio.
A non-negative integer is required.
Rounding is done to a multiple of \code{ratio + 1}.
See details.}

\item{roundUpFinal}{Sample size is rounded up to a value of \code{ratio + 1}
with the default \code{roundUpFinal = TRUE}.
If \code{roundUpFinal = FALSE}, sample size is rounded to the nearest
multiple of \code{ratio + 1}.
For event counts, \code{roundUpFinal = TRUE} rounds final event count up;
otherwise, just rounded if \code{roundUpFinal = FALSE}.
See details.}
}
\value{
Output is an object of the same class as input \code{x}; i.e.,
  \code{gsDesign} with integer vector for \code{n.I} or \code{gsSurv}
  with integer vector \code{n.I} and integer total sample size. See details.
}
\description{
Translate group sequential design to integer events (survival designs)
or sample size (other designs)
}
\details{
The default of \code{ratio = 0, roundUpFinal = TRUE} will just round up
the sample size (also event count) being rounded up.
Rounding of event count targets is not impacted by \code{ratio}.
A positive integer value of \code{ratio} is required and the sample size
will be rounded to a multiple of \code{ratio + 1}.
The most common example would be if there is 1:1 randomization and the user
wishes an even sample size, then set \code{ratio = 1}.
If \code{ratio = 3}, rounding for final sample size is done to a multiple of
3 + 1 = 4;  this could represent a 3:1 or 1:3 randomization ratio.
For 3:2 randomization, \code{ratio = 4} would ensure rounding sample size
to a multiple of 5.

See \code{vignette("toInteger")} for more examples with further details.
