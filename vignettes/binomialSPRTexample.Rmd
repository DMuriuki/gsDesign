# Overview

The sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) was proposed by @wald1947sequential
as a way to do continuous sampling to establish or raise concerns about product quality.
There is a wide literature on this topic which we do not attempt to summarize here.
In clinical trials, the SPRT for a binary endpoint can be useful to raise or alleviate concerns about a short-term endpoint such as occurrence of an important safety endpoint or, for efficacy, a response rate.
The function `binomialSPRT()` implement a single arm version of the SPRT for a binary outcome. 

# Initial code

```{r}
library(gsDesign)
b <- binomialSPRT(p0 = .1, p1 = .35, alpha = .08, beta = .2, minn = 10, maxn = 25)
plot(b)
```

# Markdown syntax

This is an **R Markdown** HTML vignette. Markdown is a simple _formatting syntax_
for authoring HTML, PDF, and Word documents.

$$x^n + y^n = z^n$$

When you click the _Knit_ button a document will be generated that includes both
content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

Here is an inline equation $A = \pi r^2$.

# Syntax highlighting

This is inline `code`.

This is a code block:

```{r}
seq_len(10)
```

This is another code block, without evaluation:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("dplyr")

starwars %>% 
  filter(species == "Droid")

starwars %>% 
  select(name, ends_with("color"))

starwars %>% 
  mutate(name, bmi = mass / ((height / 100) ^ 2)) %>%
  select(name:mass, bmi)
```

# Figures

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure: Insert caption here.", fig.asp=1, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
pal <- c(
  "#00857c", "#0c2340", "#6eceb2", "#bfed33", "#fff063",
  "#69b8f7", "#688ce8", "#5450e4"
)

x <- log(1:length(pal) + 1)
barplot(x, col = pal, border = FALSE)
```

# Tables

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars))
```

for details.

# Markdown tables

We support Markdown tables via
[pandoc table syntax](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#tables).

You can use any online Markdown table generator to create these tables.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

# Markdown figures

Without caption:

```markdown
#![](example.png){width=50% class="center-block"}
```

With caption:

```markdown
#![Insert caption here.](example.png){width=50%}
```
